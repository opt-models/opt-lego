# opt-lego

This is the home of the Multi-Build Search app developed over the course of the video series hosted at [opt-models.org](https://opt-models.org/).

The app searches for multiple LEGO® sets buildable concurrently from one person's part inventory and is  at its heart a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), solving problems it generates with the excellent open source [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) linear integer solver. See the [Problem Description](https://github.com/opt-models/opt-lego/blob/main/PROBLEM-DESCRIPTION.md) for more.

The app is inspired by Rebrickable.com's terrific existing Build Search feature at https://rebrickable.com/build/ and it's development is enabled by Rebrickable's generous sharing of their LEGO part and set data at https://rebrickable.com/downloads/. (Thank you Rebrickable Team!!! ❤️ )

See and discuss the app's development (currently still in process) at [opt-models.org](https://opt-models.org/).
